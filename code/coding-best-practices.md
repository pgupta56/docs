# Coding Best Practices
## Common
#### Syntax
* Naming conventions should be consistent (camelCase and variable name should be descriptive enough to indicate it's use )
* Function parameter should contains mandatory fields first and optional fields afterwards


#### Approach
* Function should handle once specific concerns only (Refactor funtiion creating more functions to fix this)
* Function parameter should be of type final ( Unless we really need to change the Object being passed for some wired reason ) 
* Return Empty Collections instead of Null
