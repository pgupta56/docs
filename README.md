## CONCEPTS
### Object Oriented Principles

#### Four Principles
| Tables                             | Details          
| -------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Encapsulation  | mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods.  |
| Abstraction    | one class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it |
| Inheritance    |  |
| Polymorphism   |  |


#### SOLID Principles
| Tables                             | Details          
| ---------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Single Responsibility Principle    | One class should have one and only one responsibility . We should write, change and maintain a class for only one purpose |
| Open Closed Principle              | Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Classes should be designed such a way that whenever fellow developers wants to change the flow of control in specific conditions in application, all they need to extend our class and override some functions |
| Liskov's Substitution Principle    | Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types . Objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass |
| Interface Segregation Principle    | Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use. Each Interfaces should have a single responsibility principle holds to classes |
| Dependency Inversion Principle     | Depend on abstractions, not on cretions. Modules can be separated from each other using an abstract layer to bind them together |
